# Proposal - Potential Chainsaw

## Introduction
Online news sources are abundant and highly convienient to the average user, but how can someone be sure about the level of bias present in what they are reading?

They cannot, bias is inherent to every work.

Instead we aim to acheive an awareness of bias in all stories and posts consumers read. By presenting articles side-by-side and clearly displaying the alignment of the person/people behind it, we hope to assist users in being conscious of what they are reading and broadly encourage the critical evaluation of media.

## Concept
We arent trying to produce the new all encompassing social media craze, more a hot-debate of the day that can brefiley engage users but also allow for extended reading into other viewpoints.

We will deliver a news source pooling website, which focuses on comparing articles while delivering convienient news. Each day, a single topic will be posted and a number of articles (2-5) on that topic/story will be selected for display. The articles will be taken from all kinds of news sources and rated by a variety of socio/political leanings (using the economic/social progressive/consevative matrix). Complex methods of discussion will be facilitated, including quoting parts of the article, emotional responses, and the ability to build comment threads in various places within an article, as well as a general thread at the end. After 24 hours has passed, the discussion is locked and no further changes can be made.

## User Interaction
Users must register to post/vote but anyone may view.
Accounts may be created from Facebook/Google but display names should be semi-anonymous to encourage open discussion.

Users can up and downvote each article on the topic bsaed upon their agreement with the presentation/language/opinion of the publisher. Users can also rate each others comments that are made on the topic.

User accounts will develop their own matrix rating as they vote/comment/are voted upon which is openly displayed on comments/account pages.
Articles are tagged/coloured/marked based upon what kind of users vote for them.

Comments will be arranged based upon discussion contribution but will only compete with comments from similar matrix ratings (alternativley: only votes from similar ratings will count towards display order/score totals are seperated based on ideology). This allows users to be exposed to a variety of views while still encouraged positive contribution.

## Team

  - Dean Langton - 42911067 - IT, Web development and programming

  - Clancy O'Reilly - 43709672 - IT, Research and coordination 

  - Nathan Squire - 43930421 - IT, Design and UI/UX

  - Benjamin Pallay - 43221811 - Computer Science, Back end and programming

## Communications
The main form of communication within our team is Slack, which will be expected to be regularly checked. We will will also strive to communicate through github comments and zenhub, in order to make sure discussion is documented. For file sharing, we will primarily use github, as well as google drive where convienient.

## Plan

Week 7 - Planning and research. Learn more about the fields we are working in and the market we are creating the project for, such as variables for the political spectrum matrix and social groups who have interests in political matters.

Week 8 - Digital interactive prototype. Design a prototype with a full featured front end, and little or no backend, for the purpose testing. This might be done in invision, or as a simple web app in html, css, and javascript. We will begin a steady process of constructing the website and backend staring this week, leaving front end design elements to be tested in future weeks before implementation.

Week 9 - Testing. Perform user tests and heuristics to see where our application needs refining and if our compass rating system is consistent with personal beliefs.

Week 10 - Interim. Design a second version, and get feedback.

Week 12 - Interim. Design a third version, and get feedback once again.

Week 13 - Final Product. Deliver the final product.

# Feedback
Ideas for Types of matricies/scales, possibly apolitical, positive vs negative language articles -> then rating users based upon progressive/conservative leanings

Interaction ideas, methods of rating, implementation of scoring systems
