                    <h3>The Problem</h3>
                    <p>Media bias has been and will continue to be an important challenge that the journalism industry must face head on if it wishes to remain relevant and uphold its principle of objectivity. Political journalism is one of the most often criticised forms of journalism for the bias that is displayed. According to a survey conducted November 7, 2015 by the First Amendment Center and USA Today 70 percent of Americans believe that news media is intentionally biased.</p>
                    <p>The question is, how can consumers best be protected from the bias that is present in media. One way is to try and remove all of the bias, which is idealistic, hasn't worked in the past and probably never will. This solution assumes that consumers are not able to discern the bias and are helpless to it. Rather than trying to eliminate bias entirely, what if the solution to the problem is to bring discussion about bias to the forefront, trusting consumers to interact with the bias, analyse, debate and develop their own opinions around it.</p>

                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <h3>The Solution</h3>
                    <p>Unfortunately to date there are no applications which fill this particular niche. News sites don't explicitly display how biased the article is, social applications including Reddit, Facebook and discussion forums are perhaps the closest to tackling the problem as users of different leanings can discuss articles but they aren't entirely devoted to the problem.</p>
                    <p>The goal of <strong>Union</strong> is to tackle the problem using the second approach, display the bias that is in the media and allow users to form their own opinions and discuss those opinions with other users.</p>
                    <p><strong>Union</strong> is a focused news aggregation project with the intent to create a community-driven discussion platform. Every few days, a new topic or event will be posted on the page with three articles on the issue displayed. Users are able to vote for how much and what type of bias each of the articles displays, discuss the articles with other users and discover where they stand on issues through the use of the socio/political matrix which is at the heart of the application.</p>

                            <h3>The Matrix</h3>
                            <p>The socio/political matrix is at the heart of the application. It allows users to eventually find where they stand on issues and to easily determine where others stand. It has two axes the first being Economic running from Economic Left to Economic Right along the horizontal axis, the second being Political running from Authoritarian to Libertarian along the vertical axis.</p>
                            <p>Both users and articles have matrices and there is interplay between the two. Users are able to vote for where they believe an article lies on the matrix impacting the position of the article on its matrix and changing where the user lies on their matrix by comparing their response to how others have voted.</p>
